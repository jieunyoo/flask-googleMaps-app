# flask-googleMap-app

This app asks the user to place a marker on a map, and then records the latitude and longitude of the coordinates in a database using Flask-SQLAlchemy. The main homepage currently displays all markers by all users.

Currently, to run, add in your google API Key in `index.html.` 

Then type `python db_create.py` and `python run.py` and the server should be on `localhost:5000`

Various improvements to be added.

This app runs on Python 3.5.2 and Flask 0.10.1.
